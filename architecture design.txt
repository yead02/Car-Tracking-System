For this project, I will prefer Microservice Architecture. 

Through Microservice Architecture, I will be able to manage each of the entity seperately. And if there are maintanance work being done in one entity, other entities will remain unchanged and would work properly.

There are 6 different entities.
1. Manager
2. Operator
3. Car
4. City
5. Report
6. Tracking

Manager:
    1. ManagerId
    2. ManagerName
    3. ManagerPassword

Operator:
    1. OperatorId
    2. OperatorName
    3. OperatorCode

Car:
    1. CarId
    2. CarName
    3. OperatorId  #I will asume that each car will be assosiated with one operator only. So, I will get both car and operator information through only CarId

City:
    1. CityId
    2. CityName
    3. CarID
    4. File

Report:
    1. ReportId
    2. CarID
    3. DateTime
    4. ReportDetails

Tracking:
    1. TrackingId
    2. CarID
    3. CurrentLocation
